**Research Interests**
------------------
I’m a cognitive computational neuroscientist. My research focuses on the role of the ascending arousal system in facilitating dynamic brain state transitions in both healthy and diseased brains, and how these brain state transitions are critical for normal brain function and cognition. I utilizes methods from network neuroscience, multi-modal imaging,computational modelling and dynamical systems to explore how fluctuations in the underlying ascending arousal systems contribute to changes in brain states and cognition. I have a particular interested in taking a complex systems approach to trying to disentangle complex cognitive function and how these systems become impaired across neurodegenerative diseases. More specifically, I have worked on characterising role of the cholinergic and noradrenergic systems in facilitating global brain state dynamics by applying concepts from statistical physics, multi-modal neuroimaging analyses, neural mass modelling and task-based fMRI studies to interrogate how the brain functions as an interacting complex system.

Outside of research, I’m passionate about engaging in a vibrate scientific community, and I have been involved in several committees trying to foster collaborative and supportive environments for early-career researchers. I’m part of the OHBM community and love to collaborate on science!

**Outside of Research**
Outside of research, you will often find me hiking, swimming or going to live music events! I particularly enjoy going on multi-day hikes into the wilderness and swimming in glacial lakes.
